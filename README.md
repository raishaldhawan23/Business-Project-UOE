# Optimization of Pricing Strategies Using Price Elasticity and Competitive Analysis

This project focuses on the implementation of dynamic pricing strategies through exploratory data analysis (EDA) of both company sales data and competitor pricing data. The goal is to optimize pricing to maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market.

## Project Structure

- **Competitors pricing.csv**: This file contains the pricing data of competitors, including their pricing strategies for various products over time.
- **sales summary.csv**: This file includes the sales data from our company, including sales amounts, quantities sold, and other relevant metrics.
- **EDA of Company Sales Data.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the exploratory data analysis of the company's sales data. This analysis includes identifying trends, patterns, and key insights that will inform the dynamic pricing strategy.
- **EDA of competitors pricing.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis on the competitor pricing data, allowing us to understand their pricing strategies and identify potential competitive advantages.
- **Price Distribution - Merged Data.ipynb**: This notebook merges the company's sales data with competitor pricing data to perform a comparative analysis. The goal is to analyze price distributions and determine the impact of competitor pricing on our sales performance.
- **README.md**: This document provides an overview of the project, the structure of the repository, and instructions for running the analysis.

## Project Goals

1. **Understand Competitor Pricing Strategies**: By analyzing competitor pricing data, we aim to uncover their pricing strategies and identify any patterns or trends that might influence our pricing decisions.
2. **Implement Dynamic Pricing**: Using insights from the EDA, we develop and simulate a dynamic pricing model to optimize prices for our products. The goal is to maximize revenue without negatively impacting sales volume.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: We compare the performance of the existing pricing strategy with the dynamic pricing model, assessing the impact on total sales amount and quantity sold.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the necessary Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

### Running the Analysis

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure that your Python environment has all the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
2. **Paste it** into a text editor (like Google Colab, Sublime Text, or any IDE you use).
